Hi, I'm Noelle! I'm an recent PhD grad in <a href="https://eecs.berkeley.edu/">Electrical Engineering at UC Berkeley</a>, where I was advised by <a href="http://nano.eecs.berkeley.edu/">Ali Javey</a> and studied human eccrine sweat as a biosensing target for medical and athletic applications. I was affiliated with the <a href="https://bsac.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley Sensors and Actuators Center</a> and supported by an <a href="https://ndseg.org/">NDSEG Fellowship</a>. More broadly, I am interested in flexible electronics, electrochemical sensing, and embedded systems.

Previously, I received a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from <a href="https://ee.caltech.edu/">Caltech</a>, where I worked on biomedical sensing with <a href="https://nanofab.caltech.edu/">Axel Scherer</a>.

Below you can find my published research projects and other shared ideas.
