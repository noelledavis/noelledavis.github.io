For the community of flannel-wearing, Whataburger-loving Texans at Caltech. We screen printed these by hand on Comfort Colors tees, tanks, and crewnecks with the help of Jim Barry at the Caltech Art House and sold at-cost to students (and gifted some to staff and faculty). There are about 100 floating around out there!
